# **App Name**: Sugar Connect

## Core Features:

- Landing Page Design: Implement a landing page with a hero section, featured profiles, testimonials, relationship descriptions, security information, and statistics, mirroring the SD Connect V7 site.
- Profile Management: Develop a profile creation and editing page with sections for About, Wants & Interests, Gallery, and Attributes, with appropriate input types for each field.
- Messaging System: Design a messaging system with an inbox list and message display, enabling users to easily reply to messages.  Emulate the display shown in SD Connect V7.
- Match Display: Implement a matches page with tabs for Favorites, Visitors, and Viewed profiles, allowing users to easily browse their interactions. Implement as closely as possible to the image provided in the user prompt.
- Search Functionality: Build a search page with a filters panel for age, height, location, and online status, ensuring appropriate matches are displayed based on user roles (Sugar Daddy/Baby).
- User Authentication: Create a basic user authentication system with user profiles, email addresses, and login/password functionality. Set up an administrator account with special permissions.
- Engagement Popups: Implement random toast popups with messages from Sugar Babies to Sugar Daddies.  The messages should include a 'Reply', 'Not Now' and an 'X' button. Use a generative AI tool to create the messages based on a specific character profile for each sugar baby.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated violet (#800080) for an elegant and mysterious feel.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0), slightly violet, for a sophisticated backdrop.
- Accent color: Soft lavender (#E6E6FA) to highlight key interactive elements and call-to-actions.
- Font recommendation: 'PT Sans' for both headlines and body text (sans-serif).  Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use heart and lock flat icons where relevant to improve the UX/UI.
- Hero section on the landing page that contains two role selecting buttons.
- Subtle animations when profile information changes, and in context with receiving notifications to show smooth feedback to the users.
